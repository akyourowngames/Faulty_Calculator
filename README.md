# Faulty Calculator 🖩⚡  

**Faulty Calculator** is a unique and unpredictable calculator designed to add an element of randomness to basic calculations. Unlike a standard calculator that always provides accurate results, this one introduces intentional errors **10% of the time**. This means that while most calculations will be correct, every once in a while, the calculator will deliberately provide an incorrect result, making it both fun and frustrating to use!  

## 🔹 **How It Works**  
- When a user inputs a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.), the calculator processes the request normally.  
- However, with a **10% probability**, the result will be randomly altered to an incorrect value.  
- This randomness makes the calculator unreliable but also an interesting tool for testing error-handling or playing pranks.  

## 🔹 **Features**  
✅ Performs **basic arithmetic operations** (+, -, *, /)  
✅ Works **correctly 90% of the time**  
✅ Introduces **intentional errors in 10% of calculations**  
✅ Generates random but slightly misleading incorrect answers  
✅ A great tool for **pranks, testing debugging skills, or adding unpredictability to math**  
✅ Simple yet effective for learning about probability and randomness  

## 🔹 **Use Cases**  
🔹 **Fun & Pranks** – Trick your friends and watch them get confused when their calculations go wrong!  
🔹 **Debugging Practice** – A useful tool for testing error-handling in programs that rely on mathematical computations.  
🔹 **Learning Probability** – Demonstrates how randomness works in a practical setting.  
🔹 **Challenging Math Skills** – Forces users to double-check their answers instead of blindly trusting a calculator.  

## 🔹 **Example Usage**  
| Input Expression | Expected Result | Faulty Output (10% of the time) |  
|------------------|----------------|---------------------------|  
| 5 + 3           | 8              | 2                         |  
| 10 × 2         | 20             | 5                        |  
| 50 ÷ 5         | 10             | 500                       |  
| 7 - 4          | 3              | 11                         |  

This means you can never fully trust the calculator, making every calculation a little bit of a guessing game!  

## ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
This calculator is **not meant for serious mathematical use**. If you need 100% accuracy for important calculations, **DO NOT** rely on this faulty calculator. It is purely for entertainment, learning, and testing purposes.

Enjoy using the **Faulty Calculator** and have fun with its unpredictable nature! 🚀
